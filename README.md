# Project Goal & Description
A simple beginner's machine learning project to create a binary classifier that predicts 1 for malignant tumor and 0 for benign tumor. Goal is to find the highest accuracy classification model through proper training, tuning, and preprocessing, and then to write a full paper report. Full report can be found in Google Drive 'ProjectDescription.docx.'

# Results
Random Forest achieved the highest total accuracy of 96% accuracy, 94% recall, and 95% F1-score.
